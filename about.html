              <p>
                <span> Our journey</span> began in 1995 when Mr. Baswaraj and
                Mrs. Godawari Dyade, driven by their shared vision of
                transforming the lives of underprivileged children, founded Niti
                Niketan Multipurpose Trust. Mr. Baswaraj, a high school teacher
                with a degree in Mathematics, and Mrs. Godawari, who had a deep
                passion for education despite limited formal schooling, faced
                numerous challenges as they embarked on this mission. Despite
                their modest means, they dedicated a significant portion of
                their income to social service and education, believing that
                these were the keys to uplifting their community. Their
                unwavering commitment to helping others, even in the face of
                adversity, laid the foundation for what would become a beacon of
                hope for many.

                <span>Over the years, </span>Niti Niketan has evolved from a
                small, grassroots initiative into a prominent organisation with
                a profound impact. We now operate three vital programs: the
                Mauli Balak Aashram Orphanage for Boys, which provides a
                nurturing environment for orphaned boys; the Matoshree Revamma
                Open Shelter for Girls, offering safety and support; and the
                Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule Bhagirathi Bal Sangopan Yojana,
                focusing on quality education for underprivileged children. Our
                story is one of dedication and resilience, inspired by our
                founders' vision and their enduring commitment to creating a
                brighter future for every child we serve.
